# EMNIST-Letters-ANN-Classifier-Numpy-
This model makes use of a 3-layered Feedforward Artificial Neural Network to classify handwritten letters from the EMNIST dataset. Data labels are in numeric form where the 26 letters are mapped to numbers 1 up to 26 ("a" = 1, "b" = 2,.....,"z" = 26).

Data Preprocessing:
Feature Scaling and Mean Normalization

Architecture and Hyperparameters:
1 Hidden Layer
25 Nodes in Hidden Layer
26 Units in Output Layer
Activation Function: Sigmoid Function
Alpha = 1.8 (non-decaying)
Lambda = 1
Epochs = 20,000

Optimization Algorithm:
Gradient Descent (Batch)
